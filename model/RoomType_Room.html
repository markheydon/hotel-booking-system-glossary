        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>RoomTypes (within a Hotel) will have one or more Rooms of that type which can be Booked.&nbsp; A Hotel could have zero Rooms of a specific RoomType but then Bookings would be able to made for any rooms.&nbsp; I.e. it is insufficient to have a RoomType without any Rooms in a working system although technically possible.</p>
